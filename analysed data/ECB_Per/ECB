The first set of experiments were conducted using ECB mode, the results are shown in figure. The results show the superiority of Blowfish algorithm over other algorithms in terms of the processing time. It shows also that AES consumes more resources when the data block size is relatively big. since the data block sizes used here are much larger than the ones used in their experiment. 

Another point can be noticed here that 3DES requires always more time than DES because of its triple phase encryption characteristic. Blowfish ,although it has a long key (448 bit) , outperformed other encryption algorithms. DES and 3DES are known to have worm holes in their security mechanism, Blowfish and AES, on the other hand, do not have any so far. 
These results have nothing to do with the other loads on the computer since each single experiment was conducted multiple times resulting in almost the same expected result. DES, 3DES and AES implementation in .NET is considered to be the best in the market.
